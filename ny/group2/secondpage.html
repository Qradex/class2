            <h2>How Adams Built a Diverse Coalition That Put Him Ahead in the Mayor’s Race</h2>
            <p>Eric Adams has a significant lead in the New York City mayor’s <br>
                race thanks to his support from a traditional Democratic coalition <br>
                of unions and Black and Latino voters.</p>

        </div>
            <div class="txtsecundario">
                <p>When Eric Adams gave a triumphant speech on Tuesday night, he <br>
                    chronicled his rise from poverty into politics and celebrated his <br>
                    lead in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. He <br>
                    also had a long list of people to thank. <br><br>
                    His strong showing reflected a broad, old-school political coalition <br>
                    that united Black and Latino voters, unions and a broad swath of <br>
                    the city outside Manhattan.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, won handily in the <br>
                         Bronx and led in his home borough of Brooklyn and in <br>
                         Queens. In some parts of the city like Jamaica in Southeast Queens, Mr. <br>
                         Adams won more than 60 percent of votes, compared with 15 <br>
                         percent for his closest rival, Maya Wiley, <br>
                         a former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio.</p>
                    <p>The race is not over, but Mr. Adams has a strong lead among the <br>
                         first-choice votes of nearly 800,000 Democrats. In cities with <br>
                         ranked-choice elections, the candidate who is leading in the first <br>
                         round of voting usually prevails.</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Adams wins in the coming weeks after absentee ballots and <br>
                         ranked choices are tabulated, his victory could stall the progressive <br>
                         movement’s momentum in New York and reinforce the idea that <br>
                         rising crime and public safety drove voters to the polls.</p>
                    <p>“Adams used his approach on policing of saying we need justice <br>
                         and safety simultaneously to fuse together that traditional <br>
                         coalition,” said Bruce Gyory, a veteran Democratic strategist.</p>
                    <p>Still, progressive candidates had a strong showing in several key <br>
                         races: Alvin Bragg was ahead in the Democratic primary for <br>
                         Manhattan district attorney; Brad Lander was leading the city <br>
                         comptroller race; left-leaning candidates won mayoral primaries in <br>
                         Buffalo and Rochester.</p>
                    <p>The results so far support the argument that the movement has not <br>
                         weakened, but it might not have been strong enough — <br>
                         or coordinated enough — to capture the mayoralty in New York City.</p>
                    <p>The night featured other small surprises: In the Republican <br>
                         primary for Staten Island borough president, Vito J. Fossella, a <br>
                         former congressman, had a slight lead over Steven Matteo, a <br>
                         prominent city councilman. Mr. Fossella decided not to run for <br>
                         relection in 2008 after he was charged with drunken driving and <br>
                         admitted to fathering a child in an extramarital affair.</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Adams does win the primary — and the general election in <br>
                        November — he would be the city’s second Black mayor after <br>
                        David N. Dinkins, who was elected in 1989. Mr. Adams’s closest <br>
                        competitor, Ms. Wiley, is also Black; she and Kathryn Garcia, the <br>
                        city’s former sanitation commissioner, who was in third, are both <br>
                        seeking to become the first woman elected mayor of New York.</p>
                    <p>Ms. Wiley performed well in some largely Black neighborhoods in <br>
                        Brooklyn and in Astoria and Long Island City in Queens. Ms. Garcia <br>
                        had strong support in Manhattan and parts of Brownstone Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p>Ms. Wiley told her supporters on Tuesday night that the race was <br>
                        not over.</p>
                    <p>“Fifty percent of the votes are about to <br>
                        be recalculated,” she said to cheers.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, many voters said they ranked Ms. Wiley and Ms. Garcia in <br>
                        the first two spots on their ballots, and it is possible that one of <br>
                        them could capture a majority of the other’s supporters under <br>
                        ranked-choice voting.</p>
                    <p>The race’s outcome will now depend on which of the top three <br>
                        candidates did the best in getting voters to rank them second or <br>
                        third. Ms. Garcia struck a late alliance with Andrew Yang, the 2020 <br>
                        presidential candidate who finished fourth, in a bid to win over his <br>
                        supporters, and there were efforts by progressive groups to encourage voters to <br>
                        leave Mr. Adams off their ballots completely.</p>
                    <p>This was the first year that the city offered early voting in a <br>
                        mayoral election, and overall turnout was better than expected. <br>
                        Nearly 800,000 votes have been counted so far in the Democratic <br>
                        mayoral primary — higher than turnout in the last competitive <br>
                        mayoral primary in 2013. That number will grow as counting continues <br>
                        and tens of thousands of absentee ballots are processed.</p>
                    <p>Whoever ultimately wins the race will face the Republican <br>
                        nominee, Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, in <br>
                        November. Mr. Sliwa received nearly 69 percent of votes among <br>
                        the roughly 58,000 Republicans who voted in the primary.</p>
                    <p>Absentee ballots are not due for another week, and election <br>
                        officials will not run the ranked-choice voting count for the first <br>
                        time until June 29. An official winner is not expected to be named <br>
                        until the week of July 12.</p>
                    <p>Under ranked-choice voting, where voters can rank up to five <br>
                        candidates in their order of preference, the person who is winning <br>
                        in the first round usually prevails. But there have been exceptions, <br>
                        including the 2010 mayoral election in Oakland, Calif., in which <br>
                        Jean Quan won despite placing second in the first round.</p>
                    <p>Ms. Wiley, for instance, could collect second or third choice votes <br>
                        from two other left-leaning candidates, Scott Stringer, the city <br>
                        comptroller, and Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, <br>
                        who together received more than 7 percent of votes. Mr. Stringer <br>
                        stumbled after facing two allegations of sexual misconduct, and <br>
                        Ms. Morales’ campaign weathered a staff uprising.</p>
                        <img src="img/imgsecundaria.png" alt="">
                    <p>Still, Mr. Adams’s lead reflected a successful outer-borough <br>
                        strategy. He did not campaign much in Manhattan, and it was the <br>
                        only borough where he was behind. His institutional support from <br>
                        the Brooklyn machine and veteran Democrats in Queens and the <br>
                        Bronx likely helped him turn out key constituencies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Adams also appeared to do well in neighborhoods with many <br>
                        Latino residents — a key demographic that he pushed hard to <br>
                        secure with key leaders like Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough <br>
                        president. In the heavily Latino neighborhood of Mott Haven in the <br>
                        Bronx, for instance, Mr. Adams won more than 45 percent of first-choice <br>
                        votes, compared to less than 20 percent for Ms. Wiley.Mr. <br>
                        Adams also appeared to do well in neighborhoods with many Latino <br>
                        residents — a key demographic that he pushed hard to secure with key leaders <br>
                        like Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president. In the heavily Latino neighborhood <br>
                        of Mott Haven in the Bronx, for instance, Mr. Adams won more <br>
                        than 45 percent of first-choice votes, compared to less than 20 percent for Ms. Wiley.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Adams ran a disciplined campaign — his motto was <br>
                        “stay focused, don’t get distracted, grind” — and hammered away at the <br>
                        message that he was the only candidate who could tackle both <br>
                        crime and police reform. Mr. Adams also secured a series of critical <br>
                        endorsements and raised a campaign war chest of more than $10 million <br>
                        the most among candidates participating in the public matching funds program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Adams ran as a working-class underdog and focused on <br>
                        communities that were hit hard by the pandemic — <br>
                        a message he touched on during his primary night speech, said Christina Greer, <br>
                        an associate professor of political science at Fordham University.</p>
                    <p>“There are so many communities feeling left out and Adams, as his <br>
                        authentic self, seemed just as angry and hurt and inspired as those <br>
                        communities,” Professor Greer said.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Adams was one of the moderate candidates in the Democratic <br>
                        field and would be a significant departure from Mr. de Blasio in <br>
                        style and substance, though Mr. de Blasio was believed to privately <br>
                        support Mr. Adams in the race.</p>
                    <p>The fact that three of the candidates who finished in the top four <br>
                        were moderate — Mr. Adams, Ms. Garcia and Mr. Yang — seemed <br>
                        to signal the mood of the city as New Yorkers emerge from the <br>
                        pandemic. A recent rise in gun violence has led to widespread concerns over safety.</p>
                    <p>But Ms. Wiley received nearly a quarter of first-choice votes, <br>
                        proving that a share of the electorate liked her message of cutting <br>
                        the police budget and focusing on inequality.</p>
                    <p>t is possible that Ms. Wiley, who became the standard-bearer for <br>
                        the left, peaked too late in the race. Leaders like Representative <br>
                        Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jumaane Williams, the city’s public <br>
                        advocate, waited to endorse Ms. Wiley until the last month of the <br>
                        race after other left-leaning candidates faltered.</p>
                    <p>Ms. Garcia, for her part, was boosted by endorsements from The <br>
                        New York Times and The Daily News editorial boards, but did not <br>
                        appear to expand her base far beyond wealthy white neighborhoods.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Yang had a disappointing finish in fourth place, but captured <br>
                        Asian American neighborhoods in Chinatown in Manhattan and in <br>
                        Flushing, Queens.</p>
                    <p>At his primary night party on Tuesday, Mr. Adams smiled broadly <br>
                        as he celebrated his lead. Then he took aim at the city’s news media <br>
                        and elites and said he had focused on voters who reliably show up <br>
                        at the polls.</p>
                    <p>“Social media does not pick a candidate,” he said. <br>
                        “People on Social Security pick a candidate.”</p>
